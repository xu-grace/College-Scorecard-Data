# College-Scorecard-Data
Brief cleaning and analysis of public college scorecard data

Unfortunately the raw data is too big to upload to github, so I am currently working on an R markdown version of the script. 
The original R script is still there with a link to download the data, so you can still follow along if you download the data yourself.
